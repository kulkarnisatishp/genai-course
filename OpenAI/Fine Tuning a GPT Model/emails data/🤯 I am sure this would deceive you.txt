Title: ðŸ¤¯ I am sure this would deceive you

Hey Reader,

Picture this.

Imagine you're at home.

Kicking back.

And you get a letter from a brokerage company with a stock tip.

They predict a steel company's stock will go up.

You shrug it off because everyone has an opinion on stocks.

A week later, the stock does go up.

You're still not convincedâ€”everyone gets lucky sometimes, right?

But then you get another tip from the same broker predicting a chocolate company's stock will go down, and it does.

This happens again and again.

It happens for ten straight tips.

By the tenth tip, the broker asks you to subscribe for $9.99 a week for more tips.

Would you do it?

Before you decide, and spoiler alert, all this is to try to deceive you.

Stop being fooled by apparent luck or inflated success stories.

Look deeper, understand the mechanics, and make smarter decisions.

How?

Check the solution breakdown here.

Stay smart,
