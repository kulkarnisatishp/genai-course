Title: üêõ Dune 2, spicy sausages and AI

Reader,

Dune 2 has reportedly grossed north of half a BILLION dollars since its release.

Not bad for a post-blockbuster era film about worms in the desert.

But have you ever wondered why some films generate gargantuan, grotesque profits‚Ä¶.

While others never make it out of Sundance alive?

The difference isn‚Äôt budget‚Ä¶

Or star power‚Ä¶

Or even whose hands are getting greased behind the scenes.

The difference is storytelling.

You see, Dune 2 didn‚Äôt just come outta nowhere.

It‚Äôs based on the 1965 Frank Herbert novel by the same name.

And it‚Äôs widely considered to be a science fiction classic.

But I am doing something different now.

I am not just telling compelling stories that would make J.K. Rowling weep salty tears of joy‚Ä¶

Not just making spicy Italian sausages that would make say "no bueno".

I am talking about building two businesses, tackling loads of tasks, and growing like a young pre-balding Jeff Bezos.

I am maxing out A.I.‚Äôs generative output‚Ä¶

P.S. This isn‚Äôt all about how clever my Dune 2 references are (honor to House Atreides)... The impact of A.I. is becoming extremely clear to a handful of business owners. Some people think they get it‚Ä¶ Chat-GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, rah, rah, cool, yeah? NOPE. We‚Äôve unlocked Pandora‚Äôs box and instead of chaos popping out like a freaky little tree frog, we‚Äôve discovered a truckload of cash sprinkled with edible gold dust. Want in on this revolution?
