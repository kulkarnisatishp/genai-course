Title: ðŸ¦Œ baby reindeer and AI


Hey baby reindeer,

I watched the whole show yesterday.

Or tried to watch.

I could barely see the screen for so many scenes.

Insane.

Then the Piers Morgan interview.

It did feel like she was even crazier than in the show.

Even more insane.

The history is so well crafted (maybe because it is real...)

But, at the same time, a lot of the evidence mentioned in the show has not come to life.

None of the sentences.

Is this Fiona even the real crazy stalker?

All this is not tangible at all.

And...

(turn to hard sales mode)

Kind of reminded me of AI and ML models that are black boxes.

Yes.

The ones that you just get an output, nothing else.

No explainability whatsoever.

But.

There is a solution to that.

It's called Explainable Artificial Intelligence, or xAI.

I show you all about it in my Data Mining course.

You will learn SHAP and LIME, too very cool and visual algorithms.

But there is more.

Many more Data Mining techniques.

In fact, I have included the most impactful Data Mining techniques for Data Science and Business Analytics.

And so much practice that you will hate it.

and loveeeee it.

I promise.
