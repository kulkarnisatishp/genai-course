Title: The price of a Coca-Cola


Hey Reader

Ever wondered why some restaurants burst onto the scene with a splash and then disappear just as quickly?

It’s not just about the food.

It’s about mastering the economics of running a restaurant—something not every passionate chef knows right off the bat.

In my start up for restaurants, one of the products we aim to build is related to analytics.

We want to provide prescriptive analytics and answer questions like:

1.What should be the price of a coca-cola in a restaurant?
2.What about the price when restaurants sell on Uber Eats (or any other delivery platform)?
3.Should the Uber Eats price just be the restaurant price + commission?
And these questions add value to the restaurants.

You see.

A whopping 60% of restaurants fail within their first year.

And that jumps to 80% within 5 years.

Restaurants are founded by people who have a passion for cooking.

Even those that have formal culinary education lack economics and accounting knowledge.

And we can see that in the data.

We found that restaurants that have just joined delivery platforms have a 50% mark up on Coca-cola bottles vs established restaurants.

That's massive.

When you visit a restaurant and ask for a Cola, you get a glass, some ice cubes, some lemon.

Heck, the staff even opens the bottle for you and, if you are lucky, with a smile.

At home you get a bottle.

It's not a restaurant service, it's a grocery delivery.

Most restaurant owners DON'T understand that

So who will pay for that cola and be satisfied?

No one.

Established restaurants have figured it out.

Some even offer it as an added complementary product to increase conversion.

But new ones are way off the mark.

And, unfortunately, even though new restaurant owners may be very talented hard working, 60% will fail in one year.

Somehow, part of this could be avoided, using data to improve conversion and profitability.

That is part of our mission.

To be the right hand of the restaurants and help them thrive.

And now a question to you: do you have a side project that you are proud off that you would like to share? Just reply to this email.

To your success,
