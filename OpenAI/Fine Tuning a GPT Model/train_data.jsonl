Vanilla.\n\nNo jaw-dropping, game-changing revelations.\n\nBut it did cover some solid ground.\n\nHere's the lowdown:\n\n1. Text Models are King: For the foreseeable future, text models will lead the pack. First, it\u2019s text, then pictures, audio, and finally, video. The best models will be text-based.\n2. Customization is Key: The market will zero in on customization. While ChatGPT, Gemini, and the like provide general answers, the future lies in customized bots. Think niche-specific AI for tasks like exercises, Q&A, social media, etc. Tons of startups at the event were all about customized GPTs or RAG architecture.\n3. The Rise of Multimodality: We're spoiled, really. We expect to interact with our devices using voice, text, video\u2014whatever's convenient at the moment. If it is on our phone, we want to tap it. And that\u2019s the direction AI products are heading. Whether you\u2019re walking down the street or sitting at your desk, your AI should be ready to respond.\n\nMy takeaway from the event?\n\nAI will make copying everything easier.\n\nWant to clone Slack or Airbnb? Piece of cake.\n\nBut it\u2019s tough to copy something customized, built from your unique data and business insights.\n\nThat\u2019s your moat.\n\nBuild your own databases, leverage your proprietary information, and create tools that are distinctly yours.\n\nThat\u2019s how you stay ahead of the pack.\n\nSo, what\u2019s your take on the AI-first world?
