Imagine the time you'll save!\\n\\nFew-shot learning is your business’s shortcut to scaling.\\n\\nBy showing the AI a handful of examples, it becomes a pro at the task at hand. It's like hiring a genius employee who only needs minimal training.\\n\\nAnd then there's chaining.\\n\\nThis technique is like setting up a series of dominoes—each prompt builds on the last, creating a cascade of insights and solutions. It’s perfect for tackling complex problems in a structured way.\\n\\nBut what about the tree of thoughts?\\n\\nThink of it as a brainstorming session with your smartest friends, where every idea branches out into multiple possibilities.\\n\\nIt allows your AI to explore different paths and find the most effective solution, ensuring you’re always a step ahead.\\n\\nYour most valuable asset is time, and these techniques are all about optimizing it.\\n\\nStop wasting months trying to piece together the puzzle. Instead, leverage these prompt engineering methods to unlock unprecedented growth and efficiency.\\n\\n\\u200bGet my NEWEST free eBook here.\\u200b\\n\\nIt covers these techniques and much more.\\n\\nThe future waits for no man.\\n\\nTake action now.\\n\\nAnd we’ll see you on the other side.\\n\\nBest, Sabri\\n\\nP.S.

Text Models are King: For the foreseeable future, text models will lead the pack. First, it\\u2019s text, then pictures, audio, and finally, video. The best models will be text-based.\\n2. Customization is Key: The market will zero in on customization. While ChatGPT, Gemini, and the like provide general answers, the future lies in customized bots.

understanding how stuff really works.\n","\n","Remember that AI Hype course I told you about?\n","\n","Well, I’ve been stuck in, expanding it with sections that really add value.\n","\n","And there’s one area I’m buzzing to tell you about: Fine-Tuning GPT.\n","\n","This ain’t just theory or fluff—this is actionable, game-changing knowledge.\n","\n","But why, you ask, should Fine-Tuning GPT matter to you?\n","\n","Let’s break it down.\n","\n","\n","1. Fine-Tuning GPT: Making Cutting-Edge More Personal\n","\n","Fine-Tuning, Explained: Think of it as customizing a suit. You start with something standard and tweak it until it fits like a glove. With GPT models, this means adjusting them so they perform perfectly for specific tasks or industries.\n","\n","Save Money, Get Better Results: Fine-tuning can be way more cost-effective than training a model from scratch, and the performance improvements can be jaw-dropping.\n","\n","Hands-On Approach: My course doesn’t just give you the theory—it’s a step-by-step guide. I’ll walk you through the process, from setting up your environment to deploying your fine-tuned model.\n","\n","Diverse Applications: Whether you’re in retail looking to personalize customer interactions or in healthcare needing precise diagnostics, I’ll show you how fine-tuning can be tailored to your needs.\n","\n","Community of Doers: Join a community of tech enthusiasts who are all about applying what they learn. Share experiences, troubleshoot, and celebrate successes together.\n","\n","\n","2. Readability: Make it Easy for Everyone\n","\n","Catchy Titles and Clear Structure: Like I’ve done here, use a catchy title to draw readers in, a brief introduction to set the context, and a structured list of points. It guides the reader and makes the email easy to follow.\n","\n","Use Relatable Analogies: Comparing fine-tuning a model to customizing a suit makes the concept relatable and easy to grasp.\n","\n","3. Best Performing, Again: Top 1% of Keywords\n","\n","High-Impact Keywords: Remember Call of Duty: Modern Reader's Attention Warfare and I still dominate the SERP email? Use data-driven, impactful keywords to trigger the resonance from a previous high-impact email.\n","\n","Consistency is Key: Maintain the high standard your readers expect, combining engaging content with valuable insights.\n","\n","This approach to writing emails is all about delivering value.\n","\n","It's about offering something that's practical, useful, and can make a real difference.\n","\n","By focusing on a topic that’s not only interesting but also highly relevant, you’re not just sharing knowledge—you’re empowering others to take action.\n","\n","And that’s a win-win in anyone’s book.\n","\n","The key, is to provide content that's informative but also actionable.\n","\n","It's about striking that perfect balance between engaging storytelling and practical, useful advice.\n","\n","Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about writing a great email.\n","\n","It’s about making a real difference for your audience.\n","\n","Reader,\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Validation"],"metadata":{"id":"KrA8ZFYlyo9Y"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Use validation data to assess model performance\n","for mail in validation_emails:\n","    test_prompt = mail['content']\n","    test_messages = [\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n","        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Write an email about: {test_prompt}\"}\n","    ]\n","    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n","        model=fine_tuned_model_id,\n","        messages=test_messages,\n","        temperature=1\n","    )\n","    print(\"\\nValidation Topic:\", test_prompt)\n","    print(\"Generated Email:\", response.choices[0].message.content)"],"metadata":{"id":"LitQ8AQzI2xN","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729610049290,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":11929,"user":{"displayName":"Diogo Resende","userId":"05706604408624562002"}},"outputId":"511dca48-8c05-4f18-c81d-6f6362c9db68"},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Validation Topic: Title: 🚀 GPT-4o can do this, Body: You won't believe this.\n","\n","GPT-4o can read videos!\n","\n","Yeah, you heard that right.\n","\n","God damn video-to-text.\n","\n","OpenAI's latest API can take any video and convert it into text, turning hours of manual work into minutes.\n","\n","In my latest tutorial, I’m breaking down how to:\n","\n","Integrate OpenAI API with Python\n","Seamlessly convert video content to text\n","Use Whisper to transcribe audio and supercharge GPT-4o\n","Ready to level up?\n","\n","Watch the tutorial now: https://youtu.be/JQ_Er9bMLPk​\n","\n","\n","Catch you on the inside!\n","\n","Diogo\n","\n","PS: Don't forget to watch.\n","Generated Email: Email: Title: 🌟 GPT-4o's Jaw-Dropping Skill, Body: Can it really do this?, GPT-4o can read videos!\n","\n","Yeah, you heard that right.\n","\n","God damn video-to-text.\n","\n","OpenAI's latest API can take any video and convert it into text, turning hours of manual work into minutes.\n","\n","In my latest tutorial, I’m breaking down how to:\n","\n","Integrate OpenAI API with Python\n","Seamlessly convert video content to text\n","Use Whisper to transcribe audio and supercharge GPT-4o\n","Ready to level up?\n","\n","Watch the tutorial now: https://youtu.be/JQ_Er9bMLPk​\n","\n","\n","Catch you on the inside!\n","\n","Diogo\n","\n","PS: Don't forget to watch.\n","\n","Validation Topic: Title: 🦍 Ape king mode on, Body: Hey Reader,\n","\n","Ever feel like an ape?\n","\n","Or worse...\n","\n","Ever feel like you are surrounded by gorillas?\n","\n","Like you are living in our own version of the \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\"?\n","\n","If your working days feel like you're dodging debris in a relentless ape uprising, it's time we talk strategy—not survival.\n","\n","You're out there in the thick of it—navigating the corporate jungle, dealing with daily chest-beating competitions, and maneuvering through treacherous vine swings of office politics.\n","\n","It's wild, it's exhausting.\n","\n","And let's be honest, sometimes you just want to climb the tallest tree and holler at the top of your lungs!\n","\n","But hold up, chimp.\n","\n","Before you go full Tarzan, I've got a little secret.\n","\n","👑 Introducing the ultimate FREE course on Decision Making and Critical Thinking.\n","\n","Yeah, it's free.\n","\n","This isn't your grandma's banana bread recipe; this is the high-octane fuel for the soul.\n","\n","It's 1 hour, the time you take for lunch.\n","\n","Ready to become King of the Apes?\n","\n","🌿 Yes, I'm Ready to Rule!​\n","\n","See you at the top (of the canopy),\n","\n","Diogo\n","Generated Email: Email: Title: 🦍 Ape king mode on, Body: Ever feel like an ape?\n","\n","Or worse...
