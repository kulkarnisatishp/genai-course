Manual review helps catch any discrepancies or errors introduced during the extraction process.\n","\n","- **API Rate Limits**: Be mindful of the OpenAI API usage limits to avoid exceeding your quota. If processing a large number of images, consider implementing rate limiting or batching.\n","\n","- **Error Handling**: Consider adding more robust error handling to manage exceptions such as API errors, network issues, or unexpected response formats.\n","\n","- **Extensibility**: The script can be extended to handle additional data fields or different templates by modifying the `system_prompt` and adjusting the DataFrame columns accordingly.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TWrKtT9Gn-ag"}}]}
