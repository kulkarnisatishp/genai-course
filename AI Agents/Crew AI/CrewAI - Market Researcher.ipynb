As we look towards 2024, several key trends are emerging that restaurant owners and operators must be aware of to stay competitive. Here are some of the key trends we see as important to success in the coming year:\n","Deeper Integration with Back-Office Data and POS Systems\n","The integration of digital menu boards with back-office data and POS systems is becoming more sophisticated. This trend is crucial for ensuring that menu offerings, prices, and stock levels are updated in real-time, reflecting the most current information across all customer touch-points. In 2024, expect these integrations to be standard practice, streamlining operations and enhancing the accuracy of digital displays.\n","There are several key ways that POS integration can help restaurants be more effective and profitable. The most obvious way is to make sure your pricing is consistent across all platforms without the need to manage each one independently. POS integration allows real-time updates in your POS to be reflected on your digital menu boards. Some other ways these integrations can create value are through things like order confirmation for digital drive through and dynamic scheduling or menu presentation.\n","SmarterSign integrates with some of the most widely used POS systems such as Square, Clover and more. In the coming year we will continue to focus on integrations with the POS systems that are being used around the world. One of the keys to our approach is how easy we make it for the end-user to connect their digital menu board experience with their POS. Take a look at this video that demonstrates how SmarterSign integrates with the popular Square POS platform.\n","Strategic Use of Analytics to Optimize Menu Marketing\n","Analytics are becoming increasingly important in optimizing menu marketing. By understanding customer preferences and behavior patterns, restaurants can use their digital menu boards to strategically market items, leading to increased sales of promoted dishes and improved customer satisfaction. In 2024, analytics will be more deeply embedded in the digital menu board systems, allowing for even more targeted marketing campaigns.\n","One thing that businesses tend to forget is that digital menu boards are an important marketing platform. Many business operators see their menus as just a way to allow people to order their products. This idea overlooks the important marketing opportunity that digital menu boards can provide. Being able to direct patrons to the items that make your restaurant more effective and profitable can be easily achieved with a smarter approach to digital menu boards.\n","Lower Initial Investment Than Ever Before\n","The trend towards more affordable digital menu board displays is opening doors for many businesses. The reduction in costs for high-quality displays and other digital menu board technology means that even smaller establishments can now invest in this technology. In 2024 the initial investment for restaurants will continue to come down. In a time when everything seems to be getting more expensive, the lowering cost of digital menu board technology will provide some much needed financial relief. The market will see a wider adoption of digital menu boards as the initial investment becomes more manageable for a broader range of businesses.\n","One of the great ways SmarterSign is helping businesses lower initial investment is through smarter ways to control your displays. For example, with newer Samsung displays (consumer displays with the app store or commercial displays that have Samsung Smart Signage Platform “SSSP”), businesses can use the built in computing power of the display to provide digital menu board playback. This removes the need for an external media player and saves on initial investment. As always, SmarterSign makes the deployment of digital menu boards on Samsung displays extremely fast and easy.\n","Easier Operations with Smarter Management Tools\n","Managing digital menu boards is becoming easier than ever, thanks to systems like SmarterSign. Since 2006 (over 17 years) SmarterSIgn has been refining it’s applications to make it easier for restaurant operators to control their digital menu boards. With its latest release, SmarterSign is set to revolutionize the industry with advanced design tools that enable rapid and accurate menu creation. Even those without design experience can craft beautiful, engaging menus thanks to new animation tools that bring menus to life. Additionally, SmarterSign continues to add to its list of integrations with popular POS systems, ensuring that menu updates are synchronized across all platforms, reducing the margin for error and saving valuable time.\n","This latest release promises to be a game-changer for restaurants of all sizes, offering a level of simplicity and integration that was previously unavailable. With SmarterSign, creating a digital menu that captivates and informs customers will be easier than ever, allowing businesses to focus on what they do best – delivering delicious food and great service.\n","Dynamic Presentations with AI Integration\n","AI is set to take digital menu boards to new heights of personalization and engagement. With AI integration, menus can adapt in real-time to factors like customer demographics, purchase history, and even external data such as weather conditions. This trend towards more dynamic presentations means that by 2024, digital menu boards will not just display food options but will actively engage with customers, providing a tailored experience that can drive sales and enhance the dining experience.\n","In the SmarterSign labs our developers are looking at all of the ways that AI can help improve operations and performance for digital menu boards. Whether through the creation process or the day to day operations, AI will prove to be an important advantage for any business looking to accelerate growth and optimize their business.\n","In conclusion, the digital menu board industry is poised for exciting advancements in 2024. With smarter integrations, advanced analytics, more accessible pricing, user-friendly management systems like SmarterSign, and AI-driven presentations, digital menu boards are set to become an even more integral part of the dining experience. For restaurant owners, staying abreast of these trends is essential to remain competitive in a market that increasingly values technology and personalization.\n","If you are looking for some expert advice and a detailed plan for digital menu boards, schedule time with one of our experts today.\n","Digital Menu Board Discovery Call\n","SCHEDULE YOUR CALL NOW!\n","Get answers to your questions and see how you can increase sales with digital menu boards\n","Digital Menu Board Discovery Call\n","SCHEDULE YOUR CALL NOW!\n","Get answers to your questions and see how you can increase sales with digital menu boards\n","SmarterSign is a provider of world-class digital signage software and solutions.

What is Menu Engineering and How Does it Relate to Digital Menus?\n","Menu engineering is a strategy to maximize revenue by identifying high-profit items and positioning them strategically on digital menus. This approach drives customer choices towards these dishes, enhancing profitability. For example, placing regular fries (with high margins) next to pricier cheesy fries can lead customers to opt for the more profitable regular fries​​.\n","2. How Does Cost-Based Pricing Work in a Digital Menu Context?\n","Cost-based pricing involves adding a fixed markup to the cost of each dish, ensuring profitability. In a digital menu setup, this can be dynamically adjusted to reflect real-time costs. For example, if a dish costs 55 SAR to produce and a 30% markup is added, the menu price would be 71.5 SAR. Digital menus allow for quick updates to these prices based on fluctuating costs​​.\n","3. What Role Does Value-Based Pricing Play in Digital Menu Strategies?\n","Value-based pricing assesses the perceived value of offerings, setting higher prices for dishes with exceptional quality or uniqueness.

The menu can feature a high-margin item like Paneer Butter Masala at ₹250 alongside a lower-margin, upscale option like Lobster Curry at ₹450 and a moderately priced, high-margin dish like Chicken Tikka Masala at ₹300.\nBudget-conscious diners favor Paneer Butter Masala, while those seeking luxury choose Lobster Curry. Chicken Tikka Masala, priced in between, entices customers willing to spend more than Paneer Butter Masala but less than Lobster Curry. This approach steers customers toward high-margin dishes by positioning them near a pricier option, making them appear affordable and attractive. It accommodates various budgets while optimizing profit.\n\nImplement Cost-Plus Pricing Strategy \nThe Cost-Plus Pricing Strategy is a straightforward approach. For instance, if the production cost of a dish like Chicken Biryani is ₹100, and your target profit margin is 50%, the pricing calculation would be: ₹100 (cost) + (₹100 x 0.5 [50% profit]) = ₹150. This method ensures a well-defined profit margin above the production cost, greatly assisting in effective financial management.\nIn addition, it is imperative to complement this strategy with a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and customer preferences.\n\nSet Pricing Strategies according to the restaurant type\nA recent analysis shows the impact of menu pricing on restaurant performance. A mere 1% increase in food item prices can lead to a 0.27% increase in footfall. \nCustomers look to higher menu prices as a sign of higher quality and value and are more willing to visit the restaurant.\nBefore setting prices for your restaurant menu, it’s crucial to remember the type of restaurant you operate. Your pricing should include the following factors: raw materials, labor, interior decor, maintenance, and miscellaneous expenses. The target is to ensure the menu price reflects your food cost, overhead, labor, and desired profit for each item.\nTo effectively manage this, you can calculate your Gross Margin Value (GMV): \nGMV=(Total Revenue earned – Cost of Goods Sold) /Revenue \nAiming for a GMV between 60-65% is typical, but this can vary based on the type of restaurant. Different restaurant formats have varying overheads and service levels, influencing their GMV:\nFine Dining Restaurants – 75%.\nCasual Dining Restaurants – 55%.\nQuick Service Restaurants (QSRs) – 45%.\n\nPremium Pricing Strategy for Exotic Cuisine \nWith the rising trend of exotic cuisines in India, as highlighted by a striking 163.17% growth in interest for Korean cuisine, followed by Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican, and Turkish cuisines, Indian restaurants can capitalize on this trend through their pricing strategies.\nEmbracing this popularity, if your restaurant specializes in exotic cuisines, it is strategic to set premium prices. This trend is not merely a reflection of the cost of ingredients but a representation of your unique culinary experience. For example, if your restaurant serves authentic Korean dishes, pricing them higher than local Indian cuisines can significantly elevate their perceived value. This premium pricing creates a psychological impression of an exclusive and refined dining experience.\nConsider a dish like Bibimbap or Kimchi Jjigae; pricing these dishes higher than typical Indian offerings communicates their exclusivity and the specialized culinary skill involved in their preparation. This strategy is about the food and the entire cultural and gastronomic journey that the diner experiences.\n\nConclusion \nRestaurant owners must understand these essential strategies to enhance customer engagement and increase profitability. It focuses on adopting digital menus, applying relative pricing, and implementing a cost-plus system, all tailored to fulfill the diverse needs of your customers. Recognizing the significance of setting prices based on your restaurant’s type and exploring the potential of premium pricing for exotic cuisines are crucial steps.

Digital menus allow for quick updates to these prices based on fluctuating costs​​.\n3. What Role Does Value-Based Pricing Play in Digital Menu Strategies?\nValue-based pricing assesses the perceived value of offerings, setting higher prices for dishes with exceptional quality or uniqueness.
