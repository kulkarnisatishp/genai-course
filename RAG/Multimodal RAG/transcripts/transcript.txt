Are you looking to improve the way that you make decisions? Do you sometimes worry that you don't have all the tools to make the best calls? Or even when you hear other people at work, you sometimes feel, hmm, that does not feel like the right decision, but at the same time, you cannot explain why. Well, I think you are in the right place. In the next one hour, you will have a crash course on decision making, problem solving and critical thinking. I'm going to share with you framework thinking, how we make decisions and cognitive biases. I'm going to show you some very well-known frameworks like system one and system two thinking, loss aversion, and even some cognitive biases like anchoring bias or confirmation bias. By the end of this one hour, you will have better tools to make decisions. And at the same time, just to give you some nudge to actually complete, there is a very nice incentive. So I have a tiny gift for you at the end of this crash course. Are you ready? Let's get started. Hey, time to go through the game plan for this section on how we make decisions. Have you ever stopped to think about why we make the decisions that we make? Or why do we tend to avoid certain risks while jumping at others? Well, buckle up, because today we're starting our journey into the world of decision making and problem solving. We'll explore concepts like narrow framing, loss aversion, uncertainty aversion, utility, and then finally left and right brain. And just to give you a few examples, by the end of this section, you'll be able to show your colleagues your newfound knowledge on why our brains work the way that they do when it comes to making decisions. Let's get started, shall we? But before we do, I have a question. Have you ever found yourself paralyzed by indecision because there were just too many options to choose from? Well, don't worry, you're not alone, and we are about to find out why. Until the next video, have fun. For this video, put yourself in the position of a business leader. Based on your experiences, you know that making important decisions can often be challenging. Consider the following scenario. You have put a lot of hard work and dedication into starting your new retail business, selling unique and handcrafted jewelry. You carefully selected a prime location for your store and hired a team of knowledgeable and friendly employees to help run the day-to-day operations. You are confident that your products, which are handcrafted with love and attention to detail, would be a hit with customers. However, after a few months of operation, you realize that sales are not as high as you had hoped. Despite your efforts to promote your products through word of mouth and social media, you just can't seem to attract enough customers to make a profit. You start to worry about the future of your business and wonder if you made the right decision in starting this venture. As you look over your sales and expenses, you begin to realize that you have a critical decision to make. You know that something needs to change, but you are not sure what to do. You feel the pressure to make the right choice, as the future of your business and the livelihood of your employees depend on it. Therefore, you put two options on the table. One, cut costs by reducing the number of employees in your store. Two, invest in a marketing campaign to increase brand awareness and attract new customers. What would you do? Please pause here and think about the decision. At first glance, option one may seem like the most obvious solution, but narrow framing can cause you to overlook other important factors. Cutting the number of employees in your store may reduce costs in the short term, but it could also negatively impact employee morale and the level of customer service offered in your store. As a result, this could lead to a decrease in customer loyalty and the long-term growth of your company. On the other hand, investing in a marketing campaign may increase expenses in the short term, but it could also lead to increased sales and revenue in the long run. By increasing brand awareness and attracting new customers, you could create a larger customer base and a stronger foundation for future growth. However, not only is the marketing investment financially risky, since it puts further pressure in the cash flow, but it also does not necessarily answer the initial problem. A company does not have word of mouth from its customers. There are a few more issues here. We have two options that we must decide from, but why must it be like that? Why must it be either option A or option B? Why not a mix of the two options? Cut costs where possible to fund a smaller marketing campaign. Why not a fourth or fifth option about other alternatives to increase revenues, maybe even organic ones like social media or SEO? As you can see, the decision you make could have far-reaching effects on the success of your business. Narrow framing can limit your thinking and lead you to make poor decisions that may have long-term consequences. So what should you do? Take a step back and consider all of the available options. Narrow framing gives too few options and often you just pick either of them. Think about the potential outcomes in the short term and the long term. By taking a broad holistic approach to decision making, you can ensure that you are making the best choice for the future of your business. One thing I like to do is think about what other people would do. For example, in our jewelry store, I would try to put myself in a position of what other stores could do. Sure, each store is different, but often the successful strategies are similar. When I created this online course, I tried to think of 10 different ways to make this course better than any other from the competition, like what kind of video types should I have? Should it be animated or with a presentation style? Can I have both? Should it have assignments, case studies, quizzes, etc.? What would be the three best ways to make the course practical and can I do all of them? Combining the best options is often a hedging strategy that one can do. Furthermore, and this is where it gets interesting, once you are aware of narrow framing, you can use it to your advantage in business. For instance, upselling and cross-selling. Companies can use narrow framing to their advantage by promoting additional products or services to customers who are already in the process of making a purchase. For example, a restaurant might suggest a dessert or drink with the main course, or a clothing retailer might suggest a coordinating accessory to go with a shirt that the customer is purchasing. By taking advantage of the customer's focus on a single item, the company can increase its revenue and profit through upselling and cross-selling. Another way companies can use narrow framing to their advantage is by creating limited time offers. This can create a sense of urgency for customers and encourage them to make a purchase before the offer expires. For example, a company might offer a discount on a product for a limited time, or a subscription service might offer a free trial for a limited period. By framing the decision as a time-sensitive opportunity, either now or never, the company can increase the likelihood of customers making a purchase and boost its revenues and profit. In conclusion, narrow framing can be a dangerous pitfall in decision-making for business owners and business professionals. By considering all of the available options and thinking about the potential outcomes, either by combining them or even thinking about ways that are not included in the list at first, you can make informed decisions that will benefit your business in the long-term. Don't let limited thinking hold you back, broaden your perspective, and pave the way for a successful future. Until the next video, have fun. Hey everyone, today I want to talk about loss aversion, a fascinating topic that highlights the way we humans perceive and respond to losses versus gains. Loss aversion is the psychological phenomenon that describes our strong tendency to avoid losses and the negative feelings associated with them. This can lead to irrational decision-making and reluctance to change, even when faced with potential opportunity for improvement. Now, there are some super cool famous experiments on loss aversion that I want to share with you. Let me start with the endowment effect. This experiment was conducted by psychologists Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knecht, and Richard Thaller. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was given a coffee mug and the other group was not. Both groups were then asked to state their willingness to buy or sell the mug for different prices. The results showed that the group that was given the mug valued it more highly than the group that didn't have it. On average, the participants in the endowed group demanded more money to sell the mug, an average of $7.12. Then they were willing to pay for it, an average of $2.87. This experiment highlights the fact that ownership changes our perception of value and can lead to reluctance to part with what we have. Second cool experiment is called the loss framing effect experiment and has been repeated in various forms, but the basic setup remains the same. Participants are presented with a hypothetical scenario, such as a medical procedure, and are asked to make a decision. For instance, a thousand people are about to undergo a medical procedure. And the twist is that this scenario is presented in two different frames or ways. For example, in one frame, the procedure is described as a potential gain. If they do it, 200 people will be saved. And while the other, it is described as a potential loss, 800 people will die. The results consistently show that people are more likely to choose the gain frame option, demonstrating how the way information is framed can influence our decisions. From a business perspective, loss aversion can impact decision-making in the following ways. For instance, customer retention. By making it easy for customers to do business with your company, you can reduce the likelihood that they will switch to a competitor. For example, software companies are very fond of this when they introduce a free tier. This could involve providing excellent customer service, offering competitive pricing, or simplifying the buying process. By investing in customer retention, companies can build loyalty and reduce the fear of loss associated with losing customers. Second example is change management. Introducing change can be challenging, as employees and customers alike may be resistant to it. By framing change as a potential gain, companies can help employees and customers to see the benefits of the change and overcome their loss aversion. For example, a company might highlight how a new process will improve efficiency and save time, rather than focusing on the loss of the old process. By presenting change in a positive light, companies can encourage employees and customers to embrace it and move forward. In conclusion, loss aversion is a powerful force that influences our decision-making and behavior. By understanding this phenomenon, we can make better decisions and avoid being held back by the fear of loss. Until the next video, have fun! You have learned how people have loss aversion, however, people also have uncertainty aversion. For this video, I'll put you in the role of decision-maker. These experiments were done by Daniel Ellsberg and published in his paper in 1961, Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms. Imagine that you have one urn with 90 balls, where one ball will be drawn. 30 of the balls are red, and the other 60 are a mix of yellow and black. There can be 10 balls with the color black, or even 60. It is completely unknown and random. You need to make one of the following bets. Bet A gives you $1 if the ball comes out red, otherwise nothing. Bet B gives $1 if the ball is black. And please pause here and think about the decision. Write down why you decided that way. With bet A, we know how many red balls are in the urn, which gives it a 33% probability of winning, so 30 out of 90. With option B, we don't know exactly how many black balls are in it, though we have an interval. There are between 0 and 60 black balls, which means between 0 and 67%. Most people here tend to choose option A, as we prefer choices with less ambiguity. It is also a good time to distinguish between risk and uncertainty. Risk is a known unknown, which is a measurable probability. We can make the decision numerically. We know that we'll win once every three times. Uncertainty is an unknown unknown, and we don't know what is the concrete probability of winning, and therefore we can't really compute what is the likelihood of getting a black ball. The bottom line here is that we prefer certain risks to unknown probabilities. This is known as the Ellsberg paradox. Ellsberg's findings indicate that choices with an underlying level of risk are favored in instances where the likelihood of risk is clear, rather than instances in which the likelihood of risk is unknown. Now, how can businesses use uncertainty aversion for their benefit? First, clear and simple pricing. By offering transparent and straightforward pricing, companies can reduce the uncertainty and confusion associated with buying decisions. This can make customers feel more confident about making a purchase and reduce the chance that they'll abandon the transaction. The second is guarantees and warranties. Offering guarantees and warranties can help reduce customers' uncertainty and increase their confidence in a product. For example, a company might offer a money-back guarantee or a warranty on its products, giving customers peace of mind and reducing the fear of loss and uncertainty. To sum it up, a decision maker will most likely favor a choice with a transparent likelihood of risk, even in instances where the unknown alternative will likely produce greater expected value. When offered choices with varying risks, people prefer choices with known probabilities. Until the next video, have fun. Have you ever stopped to think about how your brain processes information and makes decisions? Well, let me tell you about System 1 and System 2 thinking. These two modes of thinking were popularized by the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman. I will start with System 1 thinking, which is automatic, intuitive, and emotional. It is fast and conscious and happens without much effort. This mode of thinking is often referred to as thinking fast because it is quick and efficient. It is responsible for our snap judgments, first impressions, and automatic reactions to stimuli. Examples of System 1 thinking include recognizing a familiar face, making simple arithmetic calculations, and experiencing emotions in response to a stimulus. Next, let's talk about System 2 thinking, which, on the other hand, is deliberate, slow, and requires effort. System 2 thinking is responsible for conscious decision-making, solving complex problems, and engaging in effortful mental activities. Examples of System 2 thinking include solving a difficult mathematical problem, making a complex decision, or focusing on a task for an extended period of time. And here's the thing. These two modes of thinking don't operate in isolation. They often work together. Like when I'm making a decision, I may use my System 1 thinking to quickly gather information and generate initial thoughts and emotions, and then use my System 2 thinking to analyze and evaluate that information before making a final decision. Let me give you some examples of famous experiments that demonstrate these two modes of thinking. The Stroop effect demonstrates the power of System 1 thinking. Participants are asked to name the color of the ink in which a word is written, not the word itself. This task is difficult because the word and the color are in conflict, and the participant's System 1 wants to read the word, but the System 2 needs to focus on the color. The time it takes to complete the task, as well as the number of errors made, provide insight into how System 1 and System 2 thinking interact with each other. This experiment shows that System 1 thinking is automatic and powerful, and that it can interfere with System 2 thinking, even when we consciously try to focus on something else. The Stroop effect can be extremely important when making presentations, as it highlights the influence of non-verbal cues and the way information is presented on our ability to process information accurately. For example, imagine you are making a presentation to a group of stakeholders, and you use a color scheme that is associated with a particular brand or product. Your audience's System 1 thinking may automatically associate the presentation with that brand or product, even if the content of the presentation is neutral or unbiased. This can affect their perception of the information and their ability to process it accurately. In addition, presenters can also use the Stroop effect to their advantage by carefully choosing the color font and layout of the information they present. For example, if they want to emphasize the importance of a particular message, they can present it with a font that is bold and stands out from the rest of the text. Another interesting research refers to the dual-task paradigm, which is a series of experiments that demonstrate how System 1 and System 2 thinking interact with each other. Participants are asked to perform two tasks at the same time, such as counting backwards while solving a math problem. The results of these experiments provide insight into how System 1 and System 2 thinking compete for attention and resources, and how this competition affects our performance on different tasks. This experiment shows that our attention and cognitive resources are limited and that our distractions and competing demands can disrupt effortful System 2 thinking. The dual-task paradigm has important implications for productivity and task planning. For example, imagine you are trying to complete a complex project, and you also want to respond to emails, attend meetings, and participate in conference calls. System 1 thinking may lead you to believe that you can multitask and handle all of these tasks at the same time, but the dual-task paradigm shows you that this is not the case. In order to maximize productivity and avoid cognitive overload, it's important to be aware of the dual-task paradigm and to plan your tasks accordingly. This may involve prioritizing tasks, focusing on one task at a time, and breaking down complex projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. Now let's shift gears. Companies can take advantage of customers' System 1 thinking in order to increase their revenue and profits by appealing to customers' attentions, emotions, instincts, and automatic responses. For example, companies can use marketing techniques that create a strong emotional connection with their target audience, such as using persuasive language, creating appealing images and videos, and using music that evokes a positive emotional response. This can influence customers' automatic responses and cause them to feel more positively about a company and its products. Additionally, companies can also use the power of suggestion by placing popular or highly rated products at eye level in stores, or making them more visible on their website. This can influence customers' System 1 and cause them to make decisions based on the information that is most easily accessible to them. So there you have it. System 1 and System 2 thinking in a nutshell. The next time you find yourself making a quick decision or reacting without thinking, just remember that you're using System 1 thinking. And the next time you're facing a complex problem or task, give yourself time to engage your System 2 thinking and make a well-thought-out decision. Until the next video, have fun. Do you judge a book by its cover? We all do, really. And we may be falling into the halo effect. You know how sometimes you meet someone and immediately think that they are the last cookie in the package? Well, that's the halo effect in action. Basically, it's where our overall impression of a person or thing can affect how we see their individual traits and characteristics. Let me give you some examples to really drive the point home. First, we have the Solomon Asch experiment from the 1950s. In this experiment, participants were shown photos of people and asked to rate their personality traits. And you won't believe this. But the results showed that people with more attractive faces were rated as having more favorable personality traits. Even though the photos didn't tell us anything about their personality, can you imagine? Our initial impressions can shape our perceptions in a major way. Next, we have the Rosenthal and Jacobson study from the 1960s. This study looked at how teacher expectations can influence student performance. The researchers selected a group of students and told their teachers that these kids were going to be academic bloomers. And you know what happened? The teachers unconsciously treated these students differently and gave them more opportunities, which led to improved performance. Now, let's bring this to the business world. Have you ever gone on a job interview and felt like the interviewer liked you or didn't like you at all based on something as silly as your outfit? That's the halo effect in action. It's easy to form an initial impression of a candidate based on their appearance, confidence, or charisma. But that's not always a fair assessment of their skills and experience. That's why it's crucial to have a clear criteria and stay impartial during the interview process. The halo effect can also play a role in product design and marketing. Think about it. Have you ever bought a product because you recognize and trust the brand, even though you've never tried the product before? That's the halo effect at work. To avoid it in marketing, it's important to focus on product quality and clearly communicate the benefits and features to customers. In conclusion, the halo effect is a fascinating and powerful psychological bias that can affect our decisions and perceptions. So next time you're about to make a judgment, take a step back and ask yourself if you're letting the halo effect cloud your judgment. And remember, appearances can be deceiving. Stay witty, stay wise, and always keep an open mind. Until the next video, have fun. Hey, hey, today I'm going to share the secret to happiness with you. Utility. Now, I know the word may sound a little boring, but let me tell you, it's far from it. Utility is the feeling of pure joy and satisfaction that you get from consuming goods and services. Like when you finally buy that thing you've been eyeing for months and you're just like, oof, so good. Or yeah, finally, so happy I did this. Utility plays a crucial role in decision making because it helps us determine which options will bring us the most happiness and satisfaction. And the best part? It's not just applicable to our personal lives. It's also a fundamental concept in the business world and decision making. Let me share with you two of the most famous experiments in the world of utility. First up, we have the marginal utility experiment, where Ernst Engel found evidence for the law of diminishing marginal utility, which states that the more units of a good we consume, the less satisfaction we derive from each additional unit. It did this by asking people to keep a record of the number of meals they had in a day and how much they enjoyed each one. And what did you know? The results showed that as people ate more, their satisfaction with each meal decreased. This experiment is important because it shows us how companies can use the concept of marginal utility to optimize their pricing and commercial strategies. For example, if a company knows that the utility a customer gets from its products decreases with each additional unit they consume, they can price each unit higher to reflect that. Next up, we have the prisoner's dilemma experiment, where two individuals are put in a situation they have to choose between cooperation and competition. The results showed that individuals often choose competition over cooperation, even though cooperation leads to a better outcome for both parties. This experiment highlights the importance of considering how our actions impact others and how our decisions can affect the utility not just for ourselves but for others as well. In the business world, companies can apply this concept by thinking about how their actions impact their customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and finding ways to maximize utility for everyone involved. Now, let's continue to explore how utility applies to the business world. For product design, companies aim to create products that provide maximum utility to their customers by incorporating features that customers value the most, making products user-friendly, and providing excellent customer support. And when it comes to pricing, companies can consider the value their product provides to the customer and set a price that reflects that value. For instance, a luxury car brand might charge a higher price because of the high level of perceived utility their product and brand provides in terms of comfort, style, and performance. Meanwhile, a white-label grocery item might have a lower price because the utility it provides is relatively lower compared to a branded grocery item. In conclusion, utility is the key to satisfaction in both our personal and professional lives. So the next time you're making a decision, think about the utility it will provide, not just the dollars or euros, and you're sure to make a choice that will make you more satisfied and happier. Until the next video, have fun! Hey there, super excited to dive into the fascinating world of cognitive biases with you today. And, you know, it's kind of funny how we humans think we're like so smart and rational, but the truth is we're all susceptible to these biases that can really shape our beliefs and decision-making in ways that may not align with reality. So let's take a closer look at some of the most prominent forms of cognitive bias, like confirmation bias, anchoring, linear, survivorship, selection, mutual causality, gambler's fallacy, and lastly, regression to the mean. Of course, you know, there's more. This is just a few examples, but trust me, you are going to love this. Just to give you a little sneak peek, confirmation bias can have us searching for information that only supports our existing beliefs, while anchoring bias can make us rely too heavily on the first piece of information we come across when making a decision. And it's amazing how these biases can actually affect our lives. But the good news is we can learn to recognize and overcome them. As Sheryl Sandberg, the former Meta CEO, said, the ability to recognize and challenge our own biases is the key to making better decisions and living a more fulfilling life. And I couldn't agree more. By exploring real examples and case studies, we'll gain a deeper understanding of these biases and how they can impact us, whether it's the linear bias causing us to make overly simplistic predictions or the selection bias leading us to overestimate the success of Ivy League graduates, we'll see just how important it is to be aware of these biases. And who knows, by the end of this journey, you might be even able to spot these biases in your own life and make better decisions as a result. Let's kick it off until the next video. Have fun. Confirmation bias is probably the most common bias out there. I use it all the time. My girlfriend also uses it, which drives me crazy. And most likely, you do too. To illustrate it, let me read the following news article from the New York Times from March 2022. The following is the headline, sub-headline, and the first paragraph. Bus shooting in Florida leaves two dead and two injured. The bus driver was hailed for driving swiftly to police headquarters in Fort Lauderdale at one point veering into oncoming lanes. A suspect surrendered after the bus came to a stop. A gunman fatally shot two people and wounded two others aboard a public bus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Thursday afternoon near the city's police headquarters, the authority said. Now, based on this news article, what is your view on it? Please pause here and formulate an answer. Now, for sure, where we all agree is that this is a tragedy. People are dead and wounded. Families are no longer whole. Now, where we don't all agree is on gun ownership laws. Some people believe that gun ownership should be limited as much as possible. Here's the other way around and that if people around carry guns, they are safer. Where I want to make my point is that based on your beliefs, you will interpret this news article differently. If you believe in limiting gun ownership, you'll use the shooting as evidence that if there were fewer guns, then it would be less likely to have someone out there shooting people in buses. On the other hand, if you believe in gun ownership, you can use the news article as proof that if the victims or any other person on that bus were carrying a weapon, they could have defended themselves. So there you have it. Confirmation bias is that sneaky little thing that makes us see things in a way that supports our already existing beliefs and opinions. It's one of the most common biases and can seriously impact our critical thinking and decision-making abilities. But don't worry. I'm here to help you fight it. The key is to be mindful of how you use and interpret information. It's all too easy to just use the news information to reinforce our beliefs. But if we want to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias, we need to seek out diverse sources of information, actively question our beliefs, and practice our critical thinking skills. So what do you say? Are you ready to challenge your biases and become a better critical thinker? Let's do this. Until next video, have fun. Hey, everyone. Let's talk about anchoring bias. The first case study is about how it affects real estate prices, and it is called the Anchoring Bias in Real Estate, a case study. Have you ever found yourself using the first piece of information you receive as a reference point when making decisions? Well, that's exactly what anchoring bias is all about. In a recent study, researchers took a closer look at how this bias impacts real estate prices, and what they found was pretty surprising. It turns out that when people are given a starting price for a property, they tend to anchor their evaluations to that price, even if it's not based on any relevant information. For example, let's say a property was initially listed at 500k. Chances are a potential buyer might anchor their evaluation to that price and be willing to pay more than they would if the property was initially listed at 550k. That's right. Anchoring bias can lead to a difference of thousands of dollars in the price that people are willing to pay for a property. The study concluded that anchoring bias is a significant factor affecting real estate prices and should be taken into consideration when making real estate decisions. So it's important to be aware of this bias and take next steps to counteract its effects. Now let's talk about another case study. This one is about the anchoring of first impressions in online dating. Yes, Tinder. In this study, researchers looked at how anchoring bias affects behavior in the online dating world. They found that when people receive positive or negative initial information about a potential partner, they tend to form positive or negative first impressions accordingly. The authors of the study concluded that individuals who are looking for partners online should be aware of the impact of anchoring bias and take steps to counteract its effects. For example, they might try to seek out multiple opinions or ratings of potential partners or adjust their thinking by actively searching for information that contradicts the initial anchor they received. By doing so, they can reduce the impact of anchoring bias and form more accurate first impressions. So, there you have it. Two interesting case studies show how anchoring bias can impact our lives, whether it's in real estate, business, or online dating. It's important to be aware of this bias and take steps to avoid its effects so we can make better and more informed decisions. Until the next video, have fun. There was an article in the magazine Obesity called Will All Americans Be Overweight? Now, all is a strong word. Whenever I hear the word all or always, my brain immediately gets into alert mode. However, what you need to have in mind is that not only the magazine confirmed, but provided an estimate. Yes, by 2048 was the answer. So by 2048, all Americans would be overweight. Well, supposedly, of course. Now, I could focus here on precision bias, which is the cognitive bias where people give high relevance or trustworthiness if the statement is precise. However, my focus is on something else. Obesity is defined as someone having a body mass index above 25. It is a fact that there are more overweight people now than in the past. In fact, in the US, about 50% of the people were overweight in the 1970s. That increased to 60% in the 1990s, and in 2008, that increased to 75%. If you plot these three data points, you get something like the chart below. Then, if you connect the three dots, you have a line. Now, as you can imagine, what the authors did was extrapolate until they found a year it would reach 100%. Now, you could say, okay, Diogo, this is ridiculous. No one would extrapolate like this. To which I reply, well, go check for yourself. Go to Google and search for will all Americans be overweight, and it should be one of the first hits. It is quite obvious that you can't extrapolate like this. I mean, what would happen in 2058? Would 110% of Americans be overweight? Linearity bias is the assumption that a change in one's quantity produces a proportional change in another. It's produced not through some statistical process, but instead through how we mistakenly perceive the world around us. However, this is not how life works. Life is nonlinear, and you can't extrapolate forever. A better curve would be something similar, like the graph here below, where the curve would plateau close to 100%. Another thing that I would like to highlight, there is one very important principle when making conclusions using data. The validity is only for similar data. If you use data and apply your conclusions to a different population, you must take a lot of precautions. In this case, please don't extrapolate for years in the future, like the authors. As a final note, the authors enjoyed so much extrapolating that they fell into an even more funny mistake. Their study was also done for gender. According to the study, all women would be overweight by 2044, and all men by 2054. Now, if all people were supposed to be overweight by 2048, how come men will only be overweight in 2054? What happens to the men that are not overweight in 2048? Do they immigrate and come back six years later? Anyway, please always have in mind that linearity is something to watch out for. With short increments, you can simplify and use the linear assumption. But with longer increments, you'll maybe fall into the trap of the authors of this study. Until the next video, have fun. Investing your savings is essential, and one of the common ways to do it is mutual. Funds. This is something you don't want to be wrong. Imagine that you invest 1 million today, and you have two options. You must choose blindly. The wrong answer yields you a 5% yearly return, whereas the right one gives you 8%. A yearly delta of minus 3 percentage points, so 8 minus 5. In 24 years, an 8% return will get you 6.34 million, whereas 5% only gets you 3.22 million. How does the math work? Let me show you. 1 million times, and then in parentheses, 1 plus 0.05, so the 5%, to the power of 24. This is 3.22 million. And then below, we have 1 million times, and then 1 plus 0.08, to the power of 34. This is 6.34. The story I'm about to tell you is about Morningstar, a financial services and advisory company based in Chicago, in the United States. In 2004, they published the results for their mutual funds that invest in the big companies that are in the S&P 500. According to Morningstar, they took all the mutual funds they had in 2004 and looked into their performance in the previous 10 years. Their conclusion was that their mutual funds grew an average of 11% per year, or 178% over 10 years. Now, it seems quite an healthy growth, right? Now, this is a very simple argument, but there is something that is wrong with it. Can you tell? Please pause here and think about the problem. The issue here is potentially missing data. They look into their mutual funds that exist in 2004 and assess their performance. However, what about the mutual funds that no longer existed? Mutual funds don't live forever. If they don't perform, they are deactivated. What they should have done was to look at all the mutual funds they had in 1995 and looked into their performance 10 years later. This is called survival bias. It happens when there is data that you don't account for. In our case, Morningstar's funds that were not performing so well that they were discontinued throughout the years. The study was done by Savant Capital, and it showed that if you include the performance of the discontinued funds, the growth would only be 9%, which would be 134% over a 10-year period. That is 42 percentage points less. The bottom line is that when you look at results, when you look at numbers, always wonder if they include everything. Both the good and bad results. Otherwise, you may face survival bias. Until the next video, have fun. As I was growing up, my mother always wanted to have the best schooling available for me, be it when I was 2 years old or 20. I imagine I'll be the same when I have children. I guess that is the same for most parents. Hence, the question is, what is the real value of studying at a top school like Harvard? We know that comparability is very important to understand the value of anything. However, comparing people that attend Harvard versus the ones that do not leads to selection bias. Moreover, we cannot A-B test, since it is not ethical to deny anyone an education. Hence, you need to get creative, like Stacey Dale and Alan Krueger. We need a comparable group that does not attend Harvard. People who, in an alternative scenario, would have attended Harvard, actually. Fortunately, not everyone who gets accepted ends up attending. And there you go. That is your control group. People who are talented and hardworking enough to get accepted into Harvard. Hence, we can now actually compare apples with apples. Granted, you then also need an algorithm, like a matching algorithm, to control for differences in income or other factors. But you do have a good test setup. Now, what did they find in the end? On average, it does not matter the school you attend. Your motivation, ambition, and everything you do matter more than any diploma. However, there was one group where there was a clear difference in future earnings, which were the students from low-income families. Granted, life success is more than your paycheck, but it is relevant to know this. If you're talented, hardworking, and your family is well-off, you'll be okay no matter what. However, talent and hard work are not 100% of you. Your luck, where were you born, also matters. Hence, if you are lucky, be kind to those that aren't. Because not everyone is born in the same conditions as you. Until the next video, have fun. What would you say if you had to imagine a place in the world where technological advancement and innovation is really high? Where great technologies are born and developed? Maybe you'd say the United States, California, Silicon Valley. If you're thinking about Europe, perhaps you'd say Berlin or London. Of course, you could also say Israel or China. The bottom line is that you could have some place in mind. When it comes to startups around the world, there are often hot spots where tech companies build their headquarters because that is where the talent is or would be willing to go. As a result, the hypothesis could be that bringing tech companies closer together geographically leads to technological advancement. Is this a reasonable hypothesis, I ask? Or would you say it is biased? Please pause here and think about the problem. Let's think about it. We are assuming that geographical proximity leads to technological innovation. At the same time, companies observe this and conclude, well, being in Silicon Valley is doing wonders for them. Maybe we should move there too. So we would have more companies coming to Silicon Valley, potentially leading to more tech innovation. So we have point A, which leads to point B, which once more leads to point A. This is called the mutual causality bias or reverse causality. It is also known as the chicken and egg problem. Let's look at it through another lens. You are the town's mayor and would like to decrease the number of crimes in the city. One idea would be to increase the number of police in town. There are two things here. Increasing the number of police people is very expensive. At the same time, it is difficult to assess the relationship between the number of police and the number of crimes. You suppose that increasing the number of police would decrease crimes. At the same time, if the crimes increase, so should the police. We have one more mutual causality bias. This is particularly tricky to assess. Again, you have A. So if you have more police, you should have less crimes. However, if you have more crimes, you should have more police. So you have this A going to B and vice versa, meaning you need another element to sort this out. Being a scientist often means you must be creative and have eureka moments. This example comes from Jonathan Click and Alexander Tabarrok, respectively, from the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University. The U.S. has robust systems against terrorism, where the whole country or just a few parts enter on high alert, raising local forces to their maximum capacity. Here we have another relationship. Terrorist alerts lead to higher police force. Now, we need to assume that local crimes and terrorist attacks are not connected, which I think is an OK assumption in my perspective, because in general, crimes are independent from each other. Now, what happens next? You start studying the terrorist alerts and the criminal activity. The terrorist alert serves as a proxy for the police force, which is super smart, in my opinion. In a causal diagram, you have the terrorist alert leading to the police force, which affects the criminal activity. Now, you omit the middle step of the police force and you just have that terrorist alert leads to criminal activity. This is exactly what the researchers did. They studied how criminal activity developed during the days when the terrorist alert was activated. They found that the number of crimes decreased by seven percent. Now, is a seven percent decrease enough to compensate for more police on the street? Is it even the more efficient way of reducing criminal activity? Difficult to say, but we can affirm that the work of Click and Tabarrok was pretty damn clever. I hope you enjoyed this story. Until the next video, have fun. The 1930s decade was brutal all around the world. Just after the great crash of 1929, a lot of people became poor in an economic crisis that lasted for the better part of the decade. People start questioning the effectiveness of the capitalistic system. Did it still make sense? The story I will tell you is about Horace Sechrist, who was a professor of statistics and a director of the Bureau for Business Research. During the 1920s, he collected data on all businesses, from supermarkets to transport to about anything you could think of. What did he collect exactly? Revenue expenses, wages, rent, and all the data he could get. By 1933, Sechrist was ready to show what he had found. He released a book called The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business. Let's dig deeper. The analysis he performed was a stratification of businesses. Let's take supermarkets, for example. He created six segments that ranked the winners in terms of revenue-to-expense ratios that the companies had in 1916. That is, he split the supermarkets into sectiles. The more revenue and fewer expenses a supermarket had, the better ranked it was. Then, he would perform the same stratification every year and see the trends. Now, Sechrist expected that the top companies would continuously improve over time by improving their craft and processes. What he found was the exact opposite. Almost none of the supermarkets that ranked in the top segment in 1916 were still top performers by 1922, meaning that they dropped from the top sectile, though they would still be above average. The same thing happened to the bottom sectile. The stores that were there in 1916 were not the same as the ones in 1922. They would still be below average, but would no longer be the bottom performers. The same insight was similar in all industries. According to Sechrist, mediocrity tends to prevail in the conduct of competitive business. What Sechrist was so critical of is now known as the concept of regression to the mean. Outliers will tend to go to the average over time. Being a top performer is a component of skill and luck. The top performers in 1916 were still above average in 1922, meaning that it is likely that their skill was better than average, though their luck came to be average in the end. Looking at another example, investing. There are few people who consistently over the years beat the average growth of the S&P 500, a stock market index trading the stock performance of 500 large companies listed in the stock exchanges in the United States. Well-known people like Warren Buffett or top investment companies like BlackRock manage to do it, but they are pros, and even sometimes they get close to average. The bottom line is that one data point always has a random component. Don't judge yourself by it, nor judge others. Consistency is key, and the only thing that matters in the end is how you own and improve your skill. Until the next video, have fun. Can you believe that we are done?
